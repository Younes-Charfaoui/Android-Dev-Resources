# üöÄ Android Developer Resources 
Welcome to my personal collection of resources on Android development. I have created a GitHub repository that compiles all the interesting resources I come across, such as videos, articles, GitHub repositories, and websites. These resources cover a range of areas, including books, engineering, interviewing, courses, and various skills that Android developers should have. I will be regularly updating this repository, so feel free to revisit it often and star ‚≠ê it so we can reach to more Android Devs.
